She is an example of a balanced godly woman, who has a teachable spirit and unending determination. Rita Perez Gutierrez, Co-Pastor, Rock of Salvation Christian Center Fitness for the Soul revealed the boundaries that kept me from getting to know who I am in Christ and what my soul purpose is. The greatest thing I learned was that I am responsible for my vessel, and so I must protect it! Adriana Torres Fitness for the Soul is a way of life. It has helped me to go from fearing I would never be healthy to wanting to be healthy. I was able to release old hurts I thought were gone and that I had been sing as negative motivation to get healthy. Now it's my relationship with God that is my motivation and my soul purpose.
